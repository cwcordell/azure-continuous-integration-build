# Trigger Notes:
# 1. The default for both branches and paths is to include all branches and paths,
#     thus include is Implicit unless include and/or exclude is specified.
# 2. Order of include and exclude and their list order is irrevelant.
# 3. Triggers are evaluated before the runtime of the build, thus variables
#     and other event data are not available when the build is triggered.
# 4. Tags and paths are evaluated as an or when used with branch filters, thus if a branch is a trigger
#     and either a tag or path is included then the build is run.

# Path Notes:
# 1. Must have branches defined to use paths.
# 2. A path can not be excluded and then included unless going deeper into the structure.
# 3. Paths defined in the yaml is for Git repositories with the exception of Azure Git. 
#     Azure Git paths are set in the Azure DevOps repository branch settings.
# 4. Paths are relative to the repository root directory.
# 5. The asterisk is optional because children of a directory are implied.
# 6. Paths are case sensative.
