# Trigger Notes:
# 1. the default for both branches and paths is to include all branches and paths thus include 
# is implicit unless include and/or exclude is specified
# 2. order of include and exclude and their list order is irrevelant

# Path Notes:
# 1. must have branches defined to use paths
# 2. a path can not be excluded and then included unless going deeper into the structure
